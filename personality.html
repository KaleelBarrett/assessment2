            <h2>Impact on School/Academic Life</h2>
            <p>
              My determination is one of my best qualities. I was constantly
              trying to improve, either intellectually or personally. This
              characteristic has made me the person I am today.

            <h2>Favorite Quote from Napoleon Hill.</h2>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              As the saying goes, "Whatever Your Mind Can Conceive and Believe,
              It Can Achieve." I hold Napoleon Hill in high regard. After
              finishing his book, try thinking richly. In this book, he looks at
              the psychological impact of thought and the brain when trying to
              advance your profession for both financial and personal
              fulfillment. He has become a person I look up since finishing his
              book.

            <h2>Personality Assessment</h2>
            <p>
              I took the 16 Personalities personality test using the website
              <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">.16personalities.com</a
              >. Here are the results:

            <p>
              Reflection: 16 Personalities test can provide valuable insights
              into personality traits and preferences. While no test can fully
              capture the complexity of an individual's personality, it offers a
              helpful framework for self-awareness and understanding. In my
              case, the test results align with my self-perception and provide a
              useful starting point for personal growth and development.
